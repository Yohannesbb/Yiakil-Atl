Our Election is postponed for next week of October 31st and November 1st. Thanks

Good morning to all, we apologize for any inconvenience. Saturday’s meeting is canceled because executive body requested one more week to prepare their report and fulfill auditing obligations. One of their member is even out of the country. So we must change the lineup for Sunday because we cannot move with our elections.

Here are the lineup for Sunday 3 pm meeting. 
- ዝኽረ ሰማእታት
- remarks by election committee ( Weini )
- conclude Bylaws review
- if time allows, Elections committee may start its election rules and regulations. 
- closing remarks 
- dismisses meeting. Thanks

***Please spread the word***
